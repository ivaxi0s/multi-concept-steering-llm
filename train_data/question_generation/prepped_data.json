In 1921, Canadian professor Frederick Banting and his student Charles Best repeated this study, and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal. Soon, the extract was demonstrated to work in people, but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity.

While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions.

At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China which took several decades to recover. Manchu Generals and Bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by Kangxi, leading him to task Generals Sun Sike, Wang Jinbao, and Zhao Liangdong to lead Green Standard Soldiers to crush the rebels. The Qing thought that Han Chinese were superior at battling other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of Bannermen. Similarly, in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals such as Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as the primary military forces. This choice was due to the rocky terrain, which favoured infantry troops over cavalry, to the desire to keep Bannermen in the reserves, and, again, to the belief that Han troops were better at fighting other Han people. These Han generals achieved victory over the rebels. Also due to the mountainous terrain, Sichuan and southern Shaanxi were also retaken by the Han Chinese Green Standard Army under Wang Jinbao and Zhao Liangdong in 1680, with Manchus only participating in dealing with logistics and provisions. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. 213 Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing during the revolt. 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers were used against the Three Feudatories besides 200,000 Bannermen.", "output": {"formality": {"maximize": "Could you elucidate the strategic and logistical considerations that led the Qing government to predominantly employ the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, rather than the Bannermen, in their efforts to suppress the Revolt of the Three Feudatories?", "minimize": "Why did Wu Sangui and his allies decide to revolt?"}, "difficulty": {"maximize": "What strategic and logistical reasons led the Qing government to predominantly utilize the Han Chinese Green Standard Army over the Bannermen in their efforts to suppress the Revolt of the Three Feudatories and other rebellions in northwestern China?", "minimize": "Who joined Wu Sangui in the revolt against the Qing government?"}, "language complexity": {"maximize": "In the context of the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, how did the Qing dynasty's strategic deployment of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, as opposed to the Bannermen, reflect both the geographical and sociopolitical considerations of the era, and what implications did this have for the Qing's military and administrative policies in the aftermath of the conflict?", "minimize": "Who led the Green Standard Army to crush the rebels during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories?"}}}, {"input": "The actual antenna which is transmitting the original wave then also may receive a strong signal from its own image from the ground.

The notable absence of Elliott's father in E.T., is the most famous example of this theme. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even Oskar Schindler, from Schindler's List, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. Munich depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in Jaws is a committed family man, while John Anderton in Minority Report is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father.

Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released.

The Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni, Paola, Malta, is a subterranean structure excavated c. 2500 BC; originally a sanctuary, it became a necropolis, the only prehistoric underground temple in the world, and showing a degree of artistry in stone sculpture unique in prehistory to the Maltese islands. After 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until the arrival of a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta. In most cases there are small chambers here, with the cover made of a large slab placed on upright stones. They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea.", "output": {"formality": {"maximize": "Could you elucidate the significance of the Vin\u010da culture's contributions to early writing systems and how these contributions compare to other contemporaneous Neolithic cultures in Europe?", "minimize": "What's the deal with those ancient farming sites in southeast Europe?"}, "difficulty": {"maximize": "What evidence suggests that the population which introduced dolmens to Malta after 2500 BC was different from the population that built the earlier megalithic temples, and what is the presumed origin of this new population?", "minimize": "When did agrarian societies first appear in southeast Europe?"}, "language complexity": {"maximize": "In light of the archaeological evidence delineating the emergence and diffusion of agrarian societies in southeast Europe during the 7th millennium BC, particularly with reference to the early farming site in Vasht\u00ebmi, southeastern Albania, and the subsequent cultural developments such as the Sesklo culture in Thessaly and the Vin\u010da culture's potential proto-writing system, how did the interplay of cultural diffusion and migratory movements contribute to the establishment and evolution of Neolithic traditions across the broader European landscape, culminating in the construction of monumental structures like the \u0120gantija temples and the Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni in the Maltese archipelago?", "minimize": "When did agrarian societies first appear in southeast Europe?"}}}, {"input": "Nathan Knorr was appointed as third president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in 1942.
