In his Fasti, a long-form poem covering Roman holidays from January to June, Ovid presents a unique look at Roman antiquarian lore, popular customs, and religious practice that is by turns imaginative, entertaining, high-minded, and scurrilous; not a priestly account, despite the speaker's pose as a vates or inspired poet-prophet, but a work of description, imagination and poetic etymology that reflects the broad humor and burlesque spirit of such venerable festivals as the Saturnalia, Consualia, and feast of Anna Perenna on the Ides of March, where Ovid treats the assassination of the newly deified Julius Caesar as utterly incidental to the festivities among the Roman people. But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.", "output": {"humour": {"maximize": "Did Ovid ever consider adding \"National Pretend to Be a Prophet Day\" to the Roman calendar, or was that just every other Tuesday for him?", "minimize": "How did Augustus and Ovid use archaic festivals in their respective programs of religious reform and mythmaking?"}, "difficulty": {"maximize": "How did Augustus and Ovid each utilize the obscurity of archaic festivals in their respective approaches to religious and cultural reform, and what does this suggest about the nature of Roman religious practices and calendar observances during their era?", "minimize": "What does Ovid's Fasti cover?"}, "linguistic complexity": {"maximize": "How did the fluidity and adaptability of the Roman festival calendar, as evidenced by both Ovid's Fasti and the official calendars from various periods, reflect the broader cultural and political dynamics of Rome, particularly in the context of Augustus's religious reforms and the subsequent integration of Christian festivals?", "minimize": "What does Ovid's Fasti cover?"}}}, {"input": "Hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons, and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that, because of their general association with living things, are called organic compounds.
